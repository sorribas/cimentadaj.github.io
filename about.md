<p>Hi, I’m Jorge Cimentada and I’m a PhD candidate in Sociology at <a href="https://www.upf.edu/en/web/politiques/home" target = "_blank"> Pompeu Fabra University</a> in Barcelona, Spain. I belong to the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/survey/" target = "_blank"> Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology (RECSM)</a> and my main research interests are the study of achievement inequality, the role of schools in reproducing these inequalities and early education as a remedy to achievement inequalities. I’m also working in a project related to class mobility and how it has changed over time in industrialized countries in the <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/demosoc/" target = "_blank"> DEMOSOC</a> research group. <p>

<p> I am very passionate about statistical programming with R(missing link to learning section), data visualization, statistics and drums.<p>

<p> If you wish to contact me send me an email to <a href="mailto:cimentadaj@gmail.com"> cimentadaj@gmail.com</a>. I’m also on <a href= "https://github.com/cimentadaj" target = "_blank"> Github </a> and <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-cimentada-1740877a/" target = "_blank">Linkedin</a>.<p>
