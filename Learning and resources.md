<p>In this section you can find bits of material I’ve written over time, mainly concentrated on the R programming software. Feel free to use these resources and please contact me if you find any errors/typos; also if you simply want to point out some improvements.<p>

<b>Learn R interactively.</b>

<p>- In April 2016, together with <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/brunoarpino/" target = "_blank">Bruno Arpino</a> and some colleagues from the <a href = "https://www.upf.edu/survey/" target = "_blank"> RECSM</a>, I organized a seminar series introducing  R at Pompeu Fabra University. As part of the lectures I programmed some interactive lessons which can help get you started. These lessons assume that you have never used R and are self-standing lessons. Go to the <a href = "https://github.com/cimentadaj/Rseminars" target = "_blank"> Github</a> repository: follow the instructions and you’ll be able to install everything and follow the courses. <p>

<i>Note: Ignore the first lesson since it was a live presentation.</i>

<p>- I have been working on a ggplot2 tutorial which you can find here (update link). Once in a while I update it with new things, so keep checking it out. I plan to complete a separate tutorial for each type of graph, but that might take a while. <p>

<p>- I translated some Stata code to R for the <a href = "https://www.povertyactionlab.org/" target = "_blank"> The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) </a> and was featured on their <a href = "https://www.povertyactionlab.org/research-resources/software-and-tools" target = "_blank"> website</a>.<p>

<p>- I’ve been completing some exercises from Gelman and Hill’s book <a href = "http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/arm/" target = "_blank"> Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models</a>. You can have a look at these exercises here (update link). <p>

<p>- I programmed <a href = "https://cimentadaj.shinyapps.io/shiny/" target = "_blank"> this </a> Shiny application that depicts educational inequality for over 90 countries from the 2000 onwards. The Github repository is <a href = "https://github.com/cimentadaj/Inequality_Shinyapp" target = "_blank"> here</a>.<p>
